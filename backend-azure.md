# Azure-Backend Connect

This is an additional task for the [Backend API](backend-api.md) task!

## Prerequisites

- You have finished [Backend API](backend-api.md).

## Technologies

- Azure Table Storage
- Your chosen REST API technologies

## Task

The goal is to persist the currently in memory stored array of strings. For that, a Azure Table Storage shall be used. That means:

- The data is not stored in memory, but in a table
- Adding a new item means adding a new row to the table
- Removing an item means removing it from the table
- Retrieving the list means reading all rows from the table and return it as an array

To successfully deploy and connect to an Azure Table Storage, you can ask one of the Developers.
